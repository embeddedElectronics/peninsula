This project demonstrates how to use the Low Power Timer (LPTMR). It has examples of using time counting mode, pulse counting mode, and setting up multiple clock sources. The examples run one after another. Look at lptmr.c to see the different examples available. 

By default the OS-JTAG is used for the terminal output. The terminal should be configured for 115200 8-N-1.

Supported platforms:
- TWR_K40X256
- TWR_K60N512

The lptmr.eww file will open the project for all of the supported platforms. Pick the specific project that corresponds to your hardware.

NOTE: if switching between platforms it is a good idea to do a make clean to make sure the code is properly configured for the new platform.
