This project is a simple example that uses the Tower Plug-in Segment LCD (TWRPI-SLCD). The example turns on all the segments on the SLCD for a few seconds, and then starts a counter (0-999) that increments every quarter second. There is also some driver code to show how to turn on all the different segments on the TWRPI-SLCD.
